  The Rosielin Group consists of volunteers in the field of Medicine, Computer Science, Finance and Biology. We focus on research in Biology and Medicine. The group was started during the Coronavirus pandemic when we saw the overwhelming amount of uncertainty and pessimism. We want to bring ongoing research that gives a ray of hope to everyone and bring about optimism while not being wrong.
  The group name is a tribute to the English Chemist Rosalind Elsie Franklin. Her work is central to almost everything we know about Biology today.
